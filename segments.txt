#the application looks for the file 'segments.txt' in the directory it is in if it can't find it, it will ask you to find it
#lines in segments that START with a '#' are comments and will not be parsed

#example
#text [@dropdown option 1, dropdown option 2, ...] more text [~ default text in text input] more text
#special views (dropdowns and text input) are denoted by | the first character must be @ for a dropdown and ~ for text input

go to |@planet a, planet b| and do |@thing a, thing b|
kill |@creature a, creature b|
do action |~| and do |@thing a, thing b|
|~|
