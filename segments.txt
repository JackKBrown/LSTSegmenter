#the application looks for the file 'segments.txt' in the directory it is in if it can't find it, it will ask you to find it
#lines in segments that START with a '#' are comments and will not be parsed

#example
#sample segment - go to [@planet a, planet b] and do [@thing a, thing b]
#name - text [@dropdown option 1, dropdown option 2, ...] more text [~ default text in text input] more text
#the name of the segment must be followed by a '-' this seperates the name from segment
#special views (dropdowns and text input) are denoted by [] the first character must be @ for a dropdown and ~ for text input

planet segment - go to [@planet a, planet b] and do [@thing a, thing b]
kill segment - kill [@creature a, creature b]
action segment - do action [~] and do [@thing a, thing b]
empty segment - [~]
