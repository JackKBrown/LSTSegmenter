# LSTSegmenter

##DONE LIST

### V0.3
*	Get rid of pointless variable her line. 
*	Right click to remove, left click to add. 
*	Hi button to copy to clip board. (ctrl-c instead)
*	Format colour options button.(i have alternating color I'm not making this thing ugly af by leaving you to add horrible colours to segments)
*	Searchable dropdowns via typing part of the word
*	Add to to do list: make box for typey bits wider that a linen
*	clear document (new button in file. this is also keyed to ctrl-n)
*	Reorder. 
*	Option to tell notepad which steps should not be numbered

### V0.4
* changed title
* be able to differentiate in the software which steps will and won't print the step number. 
* Creat drop downs at top of notepad, then reference them in the steps so only need to update dropdowns in 1 location

### V0.5

##TODO LIST

1. for some reason prewritten lists are limited to 16.
2. LST needs a number indicator on the right side too. so you can tell which added segments are numbered
3. Option to in notepad make it so certain steps get highlighted on the left in some form based on what the previous step was (maybe swap over to xml?)
4. Working drop-down searching
6. Option to Auto alphabetise drop down lists
7. Save/load groups of steps (save all the segments via a parse out function to a .lst file then when loading the file just reparse those segments?)
8. profanity checker

###Potential Big Changes
* Undo redo functionality.
